# Sage - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement
Recipe collections in Obsidian lack semantic structure needed for intelligent meal planning. Current manual tagging is inconsistent and doesn't capture professional culinary nuances needed for advanced planning, prep optimization, and garden integration.

## Target User
Vegan culinary professional with:
- Extensive ingredient/equipment knowledge
- Active garden with seasonal harvest planning
- Need for sophisticated meal planning with prep optimization
- Preference for local AI processing via LM Studio
- Uses Obsidian with Kanban plugin for planning
- Wants to share system with other recipe enthusiasts

## User Requirements

### UR-1: Recipe Intelligence
**As a culinary professional**, I want my recipe collection automatically tagged with professional terminology so I can quickly find recipes that match specific techniques, dietary needs, and complexity levels.

### UR-2: Garden Integration
**As a gardener-cook**, I want meal planning that considers what's harvestable from my garden so I can maximize fresh ingredients and reduce waste.

### UR-3: Interactive Planning
**As an Obsidian user**, I want meal plans generated as Kanban boards so I can interact with and modify plans in my familiar workflow.

### UR-4: Bidirectional Learning
**As a busy cook**, I want the system to learn from my planning choices and garden availability to make increasingly relevant suggestions.

### UR-5: Model Flexibility
**As a privacy-conscious user**, I want to use any LLM provider (local, OpenAI, Anthropic) without changing my workflow.

### UR-6: Shareability
**As a community member**, I want to share this system with other recipe enthusiasts regardless of their tool preferences.

### UR-7: Performance
**As an active planner**, I want responses within reasonable time (accepting 5-10 minute wait times for complex analysis given local processing constraints).

## Technical Architecture

### Core Framework Requirements
- **Tiny-Agents Framework**: REQUIRED - HuggingFace tiny-agents for LLM + MCP orchestration
- **OpenAI Client**: REQUIRED for LM Studio integration (no custom HTTP implementations)
- **File System MCP**: Official ModelContextProtocol server for file operations
- **LM Studio**: Local LLM processing (Qwen 3 8B Deepseek R1 Distilled)
- **Response Times**: 5-10 minutes acceptable for complex operations due to local processing

### Known Technical Constraints
- **LM Studio Performance**: 5-10 minute response times for complex queries (acceptable)
- **Timeout Handling**: All operations must use 10+ minute timeouts
- **Async Cleanup**: Ignore async context manager warnings during shutdown
- **MCP Communication**: Stdio-based MCP servers working with proper timeout handling

### Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)
- ‚ùå Raw HTTP calls replacing OpenAI client for production features
- ‚ùå Custom MCP implementations bypassing tiny-agents framework
- ‚ùå Abandoning standard tools due to configuration issues
- ‚ùå Short timeouts that interrupt legitimate slow LM Studio responses
