### Pastry

## Instructions

### Prepare the Filling
1. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Cook until softened, about 10 minutes.
2. Add the mushrooms and cook until most of the moisture has evaporated, about 10-15 minutes.
3. Stir in the walnuts, brown rice, soy sauce, thyme, and rosemary. Cook for another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool completely.

### Prepare the Spinach Layer
4. In a separate pan, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Add the spinach and cook until wilted. Season with salt and set aside to cool. Squeeze out any excess moisture.

### Prepare the Mushroom Duxelles
5. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the shallot and garlic, and cook until softened.
6. Add the mushrooms and cook until the moisture has evaporated and the mixture is thick. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool.

### Assemble the Wellington
7. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
8. Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface into a rectangle.
9. Spread the mushroom duxelles evenly in the center of the pastry, leaving a border around the edges.
10. Layer the wilted spinach over the duxelles.
11. Place the cooled mushroom filling on top of the spinach, shaping it into a log.
12. Fold the pastry over the filling, sealing the edges with almond milk. Place seam-side down on the baking sheet.
13. Brush the pastry with almond milk. Cut a few slits on top to allow steam to escape.

### Bake
14. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy.
15. Let the Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
