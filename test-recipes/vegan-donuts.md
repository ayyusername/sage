## Ingredients

### For the tangzhong:
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (15g)
- ¼ cup non-dairy milk (60mL) – preferably a high protein milk like soy milk
- 2 tablespoons water (30mL)

### For the donuts:
- 3 cups all-purpose flour + up to 2 tablespoons more for kneading (360g)
- ¼ cup brown sugar (50g)
- 2 ¼ teaspoons instant yeast
- ½ teaspoon sea salt
- ¾ cup non-dairy milk, warm to touch ranging between 110°F to 120°F (180mL)
- ⅓ cup melted vegan butter (69g)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or almond extract
- 6 cups peanut oil or other frying oil

### For the glaze:
- 2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted
- ¼ cup non-dairy milk, warmed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or almond extract

## Instructions

### To make the tangzhong:
1. In a small pan, whisk together the flour, non-dairy milk, and water until smooth. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency. Remove from heat and pour into a small bowl. Refrigerate for 10 minutes.

### To make the donuts:
1. Whisk the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large mixing bowl. In a second bowl, whisk the tangzhong mixture, non-dairy milk, vegan butter, and vanilla extract.
2. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Knead until a soft dough forms. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
3. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes until smooth, soft, and slightly sticky. Add up to 2 tablespoons of flour if needed.
4. Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl, cover, and let rise for about 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.
5. Roll into a rectangle between 1/4- and 1/2-inch thick. Use a donut cutter to cut the doughnuts.
6. Let the donuts rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes to an hour.
7. Heat oil to 350ºF/180ºC. Fry the donuts until golden brown, about 1 minute per side.

### To glaze the donuts:
1. Whisk together the confectioners' sugar, warm milk, and extract until smooth.
2. Dip the donuts in the glaze while warm.
