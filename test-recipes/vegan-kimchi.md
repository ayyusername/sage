# Vegetarian and Vegan Kimchi

**Makes:** about 4 pounds  
**Active Time:** 4–5 minutes  

## Ingredients

- 3 pounds napa cabbage
- 9 tablespoons kosher salt
- 2 tablespoons glutinous rice flour (sweet rice flour)
- 1⅓ cup vegetable stock
- 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon sugar
- 9 garlic cloves
- 1 teaspoon peeled ginger
- 1 medium onion, cut into chunks
- 1 cup Korean hot pepper flakes (gochu-garu)
- 6 ounces Korean radish, cut into matchsticks (about 1 cup)
- 3 ounces Asian chives, chopped (optional)
- 6 green onions, sliced diagonally
- 2 ounces carrot matchsticks (about ¼ cup)

## Instructions

### Salt the cabbage:
1. Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters. Cut away the core of each quarter.
2. Cut the leaves crosswise into 1-to-1½ inch bite size pieces. Transfer to a large bowl.
3. Toss with 6 tablespoons of the salt and 1 cup water.
4. Let stand for 2 hours, tossing the cabbage every 30 minutes to salt evenly.

### Make the kimchi paste:
1. Combine the glutinous rice flour and 1 cup of the vegetable stock in a small saucepan and place over medium high heat.
2. Stir until the mixture begins to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the sugar and stir until the mixture is slightly translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool thoroughly.
3. Put the cooled porridge, the remaining ⅓ cup vegetable stock, the remaining 3 tablespoons salt, the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar, garlic, ginger, and onion in a food processor and process to a puree.
4. Transfer the puree to a medium bowl.
5. Add the hot pepper flakes and mix well. Set aside.

### Wash the salted cabbage:
1. Rinse the cabbage 3 to 4 times with cold running water to remove any dirt and excess salt. Drain well.

### Mix it all together:
1. Add the cabbage, radish matchsticks, green onion, chives (if used), and carrot. Add the kimchi paste and mix all together by hand (wear disposable gloves if you like).
2. Transfer to an airtight container. Press down on the kimchi so it's well packed and no air can get inside.

### Ferment the kimchi:
1. You can serve immediately, or let ferment. It takes about 2 weeks to ferment in the refrigerator; for faster fermenting, leave at room temperature for 1 to 2 days until sour.
2. Once fermented, store in the refrigerator. After 2 weeks, it will have fermented nicely and continue to become more sour over time.

## Notes
- The secret is in the vegetable stock which gives the kimchi delicious savoriness without fish sauce
- Never goes bad and you can enjoy it at every stage
