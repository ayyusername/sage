**Course:** Appetizer, Dip  
**Cuisine:** Gluten-Free, Vegan

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 3 small yellow onions, thinly sliced (3 small onions yield ~8 cups)
- 2 large cloves garlic, minced
- 1 – 1 ½ tsp sea salt (DIVIDED)
- 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp white miso paste
- 1 tsp maple syrup
- 1 (12 oz.) package soft silken tofu
- 1 tsp lemon juice

### For serving (optional)
- Pita bread, tortilla chips, or crackers
- Sliced veggies (cucumber)
- Parsley

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions, garlic, and 1/2 tsp salt, and cook, stirring every 5 minutes, for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown and caramelized. Reduce heat to medium-low as needed to prevent burning.

2. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, tamari, miso, and maple syrup. Add this mixture to the onions, scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet, and stir well. Cook for another 5 minutes, until flavorful and browned. Let cool slightly.

3. In a bowl, whisk together the silken tofu, lemon juice, and remaining 1/2 tsp salt. Fold the onions into the tofu mixture until combined. Taste and adjust as needed.

4. Serve warm with pita bread, tortilla chips, crackers, and/or sliced veggies. Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley.

5. Store leftover dip in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. Not freezer friendly.

## Notes
- For a creamier/richer dip, substitute the lemon juice with 1/4 cup vegan sour cream
