**Prep Time:** 30 minutes  
**Cook Time:** 1 hour 15 minutes  
**Dietary:** Vegan, High Protein

## Ingredients

- 5.3 ounces firm tofu
- 7 ounces cooked white navy beans or young green jackfruit
- 9 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp oil
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp white miso
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp ground white pepper
- 1/8 tsp baking soda
- 6 ounces vital wheat gluten
- 1 ounce all-purpose flour

## Instructions

### Prepare the dough
1. **Add ingredients to blender:** Drain and rinse the tofu. Pat it dry very well with kitchen paper towels. Add it to a high-speed blender along with the drained white navy beans, water, oil, onion powder, white miso, salt, garlic powder, ground white pepper, and baking soda.

2. **Blend until smooth:** Blend on high speed for 20-30 seconds or until the mixture is smooth and creamy.

### Knead the dough
3. Transfer the wet mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the vital wheat gluten and all-purpose flour.

4. **Knead:** Knead on Speed 2 for about 10 minutes. At first, it will look very wet, which is normal. Keep kneading until it develops a stretchy and fibrous texture.

### Wrap
5. **Divide the dough:** Divide the dough into two balls and shape each ball into a 5-inch (13cm) long log.

6. **Wrap:** Wrap each loaf in a sheet of parchment paper. Next, wrap each loaf very tightly in a layer of aluminum foil. Wrap in a second layer of aluminum.

### Cook
7. **Steaming Method:** Place the loaves in a bamboo steamer basket and place the basket on top of a pot of boiling water over medium heat. Steam for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

8. **Instant Pot Method:** Fill the Instant Pot with cold water to 2/3 full. Place the seitan logs in the pressure cooker. Pressure cook for 30 minutes.

9. **Refrigerate** the loaves for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight before shredding them into pieces.
