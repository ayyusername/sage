**Author:** Ali Slagle  
**Prep Time:** 15 minutes  
**Course:** Lunch, Side Dish  
**Dietary:** Vegetarian (can be made vegan)

*This salad starts with raw broccoli florets and stems, thinly sliced into irregular shapes to create many textures.*

## Ingredients

- 1 small shallot, thinly sliced
- 1 1/2 pounds broccoli (about 2 medium heads)
- Kosher salt and black pepper
- 1/2 cup roasted, salted almonds, coarsely chopped
- 1/4 cup drained, sliced pickled peppers, such as peperoncini
- 1/4 cup pitted, torn olives, such as kalamata or Castelvetrano
- 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
- 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, plus more as needed
- 3 slices provolone (about 3 ounces), torn or cut into bite-size pieces
  *(omit for vegan or substitute with vegan cheese)*

## Instructions

1. **Rinse the shallot:** Rinse the sliced shallot under cold water and transfer to a large bowl.

2. **Prepare the broccoli:**
   - Cut the stalks away from the broccoli heads
   - Using a knife or vegetable peeler, remove the fibrous outer layer of the stalks so its light green insides emerge
   - Thinly slice the stalks crosswise, then thinly slice the heads into bite-size pieces
   - A mix of shapes and sizes adds texture to the salad, so chop up the broccoli a few ways
   - Transfer to the large bowl as you go

3. **Season and mix:** Season the broccoli generously with salt and pepper, then add the almonds, pickled peppers, olives, oil, vinegar, and provolone. Toss vigorously with a spoon until everything is combined and the broccoli is shiny with oil.

4. **Adjust and serve:** Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar as needed. Let sit at least 10 minutes before serving. The salad improves with age as its flavors meld, and it can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.
