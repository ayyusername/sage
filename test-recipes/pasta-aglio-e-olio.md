*Simple Italian pasta with garlic and olive oil - as featured in "Chef" the movie!*

## Ingredients

- 1/2 head garlic, separated and peeled
- 1 bunch parsley, rinsed
- 1/2 cup good quality olive oil
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/2 lb dry linguine
- 1/2 lemon
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions

1. **Prepare water:** Heavily salt a large pot of water, and bring to a boil. Cook pasta to al dente while completing the steps below.

2. **Prep ingredients:** Slice the garlic cloves thinly, and set aside. Pick the parsley leaves from their stems, and finely chop.

3. **Make sauce:** Add olive oil to a large saut√© pan, and heat over medium flame until shimmering. Add sliced garlic, stirring constantly, until garlic is barely toasted (be careful not to burn!).

4. **Add heat:** Add the red pepper flake and remove from heat.

5. **Combine:** Add the pasta, drained, with about 1/4 cup reserved pasta cooking water. Add lemon juice and parsley, and toss to combine.

6. **Season and serve:** Season for salt and pepper, and serve immediately.

## Notes

- The key is not to burn the garlic - it should be just barely golden
- The pasta water helps create a silky sauce that coats the noodles
- This is all about technique and timing - simple ingredients, perfect execution
- Serve immediately while hot

## Tips

- Use the best quality olive oil you can afford
- Fresh parsley is essential - don't substitute dried
- Some people add grated Parmesan, but the traditional version is vegan as-is
