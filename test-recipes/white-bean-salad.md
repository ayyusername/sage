*This substantial salad is perfect for any occasion. It's best made with large dried white beans like cannellini, simmered at home, but canned beans work just fine.*

## Ingredients

### For the Salad
- 1 small head cauliflower, cut into ½-inch slices
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and black pepper
- 4 cups cooked white beans or 2 (15-ounce) cans, drained
- 1 cup thinly sliced celery heart (the tender inner stalks and leaves)
- 3 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 3 tablespoons slivered scallions

### For the Dressing
- 1 large shallot, diced small
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more to taste
- ½ teaspoon ground fennel (optional)
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions

1. **Roast cauliflower:** Heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the cauliflower on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat, then roast on the top rack until nicely browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside to cool.

2. **Make the dressing:** Combine shallot, mustard, lemon juice, lemon zest, vinegar, and ground fennel (if using) in a small bowl. Stir well, then whisk in the olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

3. **Assemble the salad:** Place the beans in a low salad bowl. Add celery and cauliflower, pour the dressing over, and toss carefully to avoid crushing the beans. Let the salad rest for 30 minutes to meld flavors. Taste and adjust for salt, acid, and oil. Add parsley and scallions, toss again, and serve at room temperature.

## Notes

- Using dried beans and roasting/grilling the cauliflower enhances the flavor
- For an extra punch, consider adding feta or smoked salmon (omit for vegan)
- The cauliflower can be grilled instead of roasted for a smoky flavor
- This salad improves with time as flavors meld

## Tips

- Don't overcook the cauliflower - it should be tender but still have some bite
- The salad is best served at room temperature
- Can be made ahead and refrigerated, just bring to room temperature before serving
