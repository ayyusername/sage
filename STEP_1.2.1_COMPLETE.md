**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ CORE TESTS PASSING  
**Model**: Llama 3.2 3B Instruct

## 🎉 Major Achievement

Successfully implemented a working file search agent that can:
- Discover and list recipe files
- Read specific recipe content 
- Search for recipes by type/criteria
- Use proper MCP tool calling workflows

## ✅ Test Results

| Test | Query | Status | Achievement |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Test 1** | "What recipe files do you have available?" | ✅ PASS | Lists all 10 recipe files correctly |
| **Test 2** | "Show me ingredients in Cashew Alfredo" | ✅ PASS | Reads file, finds all 6 ingredients |
| **Test 3** | "Find me vegan pasta recipes" | ✅ PASS | Searches and finds `pasta-aglio-e-olio.md` |

## 🔧 Technical Success

### Root Issue Solved
- **Problem**: qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-mlx called non-existent `ask_question` tool
- **Solution**: Upgraded to Llama 3.2 3B which properly executes MCP tools
- **Result**: Reliable `read_file` and `list_directory` tool usage

### Key Tools Working
- ✅ **File Discovery**: `list_directory("/Users/josh/Rose/sage/test-recipes")`
- ✅ **Content Reading**: `read_file("/Users/josh/Rose/sage/test-recipes/sample-recipe.md")`
- ✅ **Search Workflows**: Multi-step discovery → reading → extraction

### Agent Capabilities
- Natural language query understanding
- Appropriate tool selection based on query type
- Multi-step search workflows for complex queries
- Accurate content extraction and ingredient identification

## 📁 Files Updated
- `sage_agent_tiny.py` - Enhanced with better prompting
- `test_runner.py` - Progressive test suite
- `tests.md` - 5 comprehensive test scenarios
- Documentation updated to reflect success

## 🔄 Next Steps

Ready for **Step 1.2.2**: Advanced Search Features
- Test 4: Complex ingredient-based search across multiple recipes  
- Test 5: Multi-criteria search with ranking and recommendations

## 🏆 Key Learning

**Model selection is critical for MCP tool calling**. Larger models (3B+) handle structured tool calls much better than smaller models (0.5B) for this architecture.
