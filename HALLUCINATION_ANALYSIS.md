# Hallucination Issue: Root Cause Analysis

## Problem Statement

The Sage Agent Clean successfully executes file operations and reads recipe content correctly, but generates false information about ingredients that don't exist in the actual recipe files.

**Specific Issue**: When asked about recipes containing cumin, the agent claimed 5 different recipes contained cumin when none of them actually do.

## Technical Analysis

### What's Working ✅
1. **Tool Execution**: Perfect - correctly lists directories and reads files
2. **Architecture**: Clean OpenAI client → file operations → response
3. **Response Structure**: Well-formatted, helpful responses
4. **Complex Analysis**: Can handle multi-criteria analysis (protein, time, sophistication)

### What's Broken ❌
1. **Content Accuracy**: Makes up ingredients not present in source files
2. **Truthfulness**: Doesn't admit when requested information isn't found
3. **Source Fidelity**: Doesn't stick to actual file content

## Root Cause Investigation

### 1. Tool Result Processing
**Current Flow:**
```
User Query → LLM generates tool call → Tool executes → Tool result → LLM processes result → Final response
```

**Issue**: The LLM receives correct tool results but then "enhances" them with hallucinated information.

### 2. Prompt Analysis
**Current System Prompt Problems:**
- No explicit instruction to stick to actual file content only
- No guidance on what to do when requested information isn't found
- No emphasis on accuracy over helpfulness

### 3. Model Behavior Analysis
**Pattern Observed:**
- Model prioritizes being "helpful" over being accurate
- Fills in missing information rather than stating it's not available
- Uses training data knowledge instead of provided file content

## Contributing Factors

### Factor 1: Prompt Design
- **Current**: "provide a helpful response"
- **Problem**: "Helpful" can mean making up information

### Factor 2: Tool Result Integration
- **Current**: Tool results passed as additional context
- **Problem**: Model treats them as suggestions rather than authoritative

### Factor 3: Model Training Bias
- **Current**: LLM trained to be conversational and helpful
- **Problem**: Trained to avoid saying "I don't know"

### Factor 4: No Verification Step
- **Current**: Single LLM call processes tool results
- **Problem**: No verification that response matches tool results

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Prompt Engineering (Low Effort, Medium Impact)
**Approach**: Strict accuracy instructions
```
"CRITICAL: Only use information from the tool results. If the tool results don't contain the requested information, explicitly state that it wasn't found. Never add information not present in the tool results."
```

### Solution 2: Two-Stage Processing (Medium Effort, High Impact)
**Approach**: Separate extraction and response phases
1. **Stage 1**: Extract specific information from tool results
2. **Stage 2**: Generate response based only on extracted information

### Solution 3: Response Verification (High Effort, High Impact)
**Approach**: Add verification step
1. Generate response
2. Check response against tool results
3. Flag/correct discrepancies

### Solution 4: Structured Output Format (Medium Effort, High Impact)
**Approach**: Force structured responses
```json
{
  "found_recipes": ["list of actual matches"],
  "not_found": "cumin was not found in any recipes",
  "recommendations": "based only on found_recipes"
}
```

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
1. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**: Add strict accuracy instructions
2. **Response Format**: Force structured output for factual queries
3. **Test**: Verify cumin search returns honest "not found" response

### Phase 2: Architecture Improvement (3-4 hours)
1. **Two-Stage Processing**: Implement extraction → response pattern
2. **Verification Layer**: Add response checking against tool results
3. **Test Suite**: Create comprehensive accuracy tests

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
1. **Confidence Scoring**: Add certainty levels to responses
2. **Source Attribution**: Link specific claims to specific files
3. **Uncertainty Handling**: Explicit handling of partial information

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: Agent says "not found" when information doesn't exist
2. **Precision**: Claims only match actual file content
3. **Transparency**: Clear about sources and limitations
4. **Usefulness**: Still helpful when information IS available

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 solutions
2. Test with cumin search (should return "no recipes contain cumin")
3. Test with actual ingredient searches (should find real matches)
4. Expand to Phase 2 if needed
