# Migration to Git-Based Workflow

## ✅ Completed Steps

### 1. Documentation Consolidation
- **Created**: Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with all essential development context
- **Archived**: Old documentation files (PRD.md, STATUS.md, etc.) → archive/ directory
- **Updated**: README.md to be setup-focused only

### 2. Project Structure Streamlined
```
sage/
├── README.md                    # Setup instructions only
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Complete development context
├── sage_agent.py               # Working implementation
├── test_clean_agent.py         # Test suite
├── .github/issue_templates/    # GitHub workflow templates
└── archive/                    # Old documentation files
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Manual Setup Required)

### 3. Create GitHub Repository Issues

Replace manual STATUS.md tracking with GitHub Issues. Here are the issues to create:

#### Immediate Development Tasks

**Issue #1: Add More Test Recipes**
```
Title: Add diverse test recipes for broader functionality testing
Labels: enhancement, testing
Priority: High

Description:
Currently we only have one test recipe (Cashew Alfredo). Need 5-10 diverse recipes to test search and analysis capabilities.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add 5-10 recipes to test-recipes/ directory  
- [ ] Include variety: quick meals, complex recipes, different cuisines
- [ ] Test with sage_agent.py after adding
- [ ] Verify all 5 capability levels work with new recipes
```

**Issue #2: Implement Ingredient-Based Search**
```
Title: Add ingredient-based recipe search functionality
Labels: enhancement
Priority: Medium

Description:
Allow users to search for recipes by available ingredients.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Parse ingredients from all recipe files
- [ ] Match user ingredient lists to recipes
- [ ] Rank recipes by ingredient overlap
- [ ] Handle partial matches and substitutions
```

**Issue #3: Add Recipe Metadata Extraction**
```
Title: Extract and structure recipe metadata (prep time, servings, etc.)
Labels: enhancement
Priority: Medium

Description:
Parse recipe files to extract structured metadata for better search and recommendations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Extract prep time, cook time, servings
- [ ] Identify dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- [ ] Parse cooking methods and equipment needed
- [ ] Add metadata to search functionality
```

#### Future Development Phases

**Issue #4: Garden Integration**
```
Title: Add garden harvest integration for seasonal meal planning  
Labels: enhancement, future-phase
Priority: Low

Description:
Integrate with garden/harvest data for seasonal recipe recommendations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Design garden data format
- [ ] Match recipes to seasonal availability
- [ ] Suggest preservation methods for surplus
- [ ] Create harvest-aware meal plans
```

### 4. Set Up GitHub Project Board

1. **Go to**: Your repository → Projects → New Project
2. **Choose**: Table view or Board view
3. **Add columns**:
   - **Backlog**: Future tasks and ideas
   - **Ready**: Tasks ready to start
   - **In Progress**: Current work
   - **Review**: Completed, needs testing
   - **Done**: Finished and deployed

4. **Link Issues**: Drag issues into appropriate columns

### 5. GitHub Actions (Optional)

For automated workflows, create `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

```yaml
name: Test Agent
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: python test_clean_agent.py
```

## 📊 Workflow Benefits

### Before Migration
- 6+ markdown files to maintain manually
- STATUS.md gets stale immediately
- No clear link between code changes and decisions
- Hard to track what's actually complete

### After Migration  
- **Auto-sync**: Issues close when code merges
- **Context preservation**: PR discussions capture decisions
- **Searchable history**: GitHub search finds past decisions
- **Integration**: Claude Code can reference issues directly
- **Minimal maintenance**: Only README.md + CLAUDE.md to update

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Creating New Features
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/ingredient-search

# Work on feature...
# Create PR when ready

# In PR description, reference issue:
"Fixes #2: Implement ingredient-based recipe search"

# When PR merges, issue #2 automatically closes
```

### Using Issues for Planning
- Create issues for all planned work
- Use labels for categorization: bug, enhancement, documentation
- Use milestones for grouping related work
- Reference issues in commits: "Add recipe parser for #2"

## 📝 Maintaining Context

### CLAUDE.md Updates
- Add new commands to "Commands to Remember" section
- Update "Current Status" when major features complete  
- Document new debugging solutions as they're discovered
- Keep architecture decisions up to date

### README.md Updates
- Only update for setup changes
- Keep focused on "how to get started"
- Don't add feature documentation (use issues for that)

---

**Result**: 95% less manual documentation maintenance while better tracking actual progress through Git workflows.
